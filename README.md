# **exploring_python_iterables-iterators**

This Project explores Python's iterable objects like Lists, Tuples and strings and shows how effectively we can use the Pandas Chunksize() method to handle large data sets. Interestingly it explores the pandas `chunksize` attribute and shows how we can handle any large data set effectively within Pandas. All we need to do is pass the number of rows to the `chunksize`attribute as we read the file in Pandas.

### **Install Dependencies:**
For this project we need the following libraries:
```
import pandas as pd
import operator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
All modiles above can be installed using pip `pip install <module_name>`

### **for More Info:**
Kindly see my article that explains with deep insights Pandas iterables and iterators and how we can use `chunksize` attribute effectively.
